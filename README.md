### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Will characteristics of the voter change over time?
+ This project is conducted by Xinying Feng

+ Project summary: This is a data story about the general profile of voter. I'm curious about will the characteristics of voters change over time. If it will change over time, then when it change and how it change? In addition, this data story can tell us about what kind of people are voting. Will there be more old people or more young people participated in vote? And how about the gender and education level of people participated in vote? In this analysis, I will answer two questions:

1, Will the characteristics of voters change over time?
2, What is the characteristics of voters today.
