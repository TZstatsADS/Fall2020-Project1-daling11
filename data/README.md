# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

My data is bigger then 100mb, so I create a google drive link. Please use the link below to access my data.
